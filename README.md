# U-Net-based-Image-Segmentation
We'll be building our own U-Net, a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, and using it to predict a label for every single pixel in an image.This type of image classification is called semantic image segmentation.Using the U-Net method I did the image segmentation for every pixel.

Due to Large size of zip file(file folder) unable to upload the whole Folder. But No need to worry I wanna to provide the google drive link of the Folder. I hope this will help :)
